# Grokking Algorithms in TypeScript

This repository contains TypeScript code implementations of algorithms and exercises from the book "Grokking Algorithms: An Illustrated Guide for Programmers and Other Curious People" by Aditya Y. Bhargava. This book provides a beginner-friendly introduction to a wide range of algorithms, making them easy to understand and implement.

## Introduction

Algorithms are fundamental building blocks in computer science, and understanding them is crucial for every programmer. This repository aims to provide TypeScript implementations for the algorithms discussed in "Grokking Algorithms."

## Algorithms Covered

The repository includes TypeScript implementations for various algorithms discussed in the book. Some of the algorithms you'll find here include:

- Binary Search
- Selection Sort
- Quicksort
- Merge Sort
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Dijkstra's Algorithm
- And more...

Each algorithm is organized into its own folder within the repository, along with example usage and explanations.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

├── algorithm-name/
│ ├── src/
│ │ ├── algorithm.ts
│ ├── tests/
│ │ ├── algoritm.test.ts
├── README.md

- `algorithm-name`: Each algorithm has its own folder.
- `src`: Contains the TypeScript code for the algorithm.
- `tests`: Includes the unit tests for that algorithm.

## Getting Started

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/grokking-algorithms-typescript.git
```

Navigate to the algorithm of your choice in its respective folder.

Read the README.md file in the algorithm's folder for an explanation of the algorithm and how to use it.

Explore the example TypeScript files in the "examples" folder to see the algorithm in action.

Modify and use the code as needed for your own projects.

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute to this repository by adding more algorithms, improving existing code, or fixing issues, please feel free to create a pull request. Make sure to follow our contribution guidelines.
